Productify is a productivity app which helps you track and manage your time. [Try it out!](https://productify-5e45b.web.app/)

I built this initially for personal use, inspired by the simplicity of [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/) and the powerful tracking capabilities of [Toggl](https://toggl.com/).

 ## Features
 - Automatic time tracking
 - Manual time tracking when you need it
 - Task management with integrated time tracking support
 - Tags for organizing your time
 - Calculate monetization for your working hours
 - Get insights from your time and track productivity
 - Works on mobile and web
 - More!
 
 ## Tech
 - The app uses React for the frontend with Redux for state management
 - Database and auth is handled using Firebase
 - Tailwind helped with building a mobile first interface
